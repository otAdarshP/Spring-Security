Spring Security:
Ensures that access is only defined to people who have been allowed by the system for their designated purpose by the administrator.

Importance: Privacy, trust, integrity, compliance.

Role of Spring Security in the Spring eco-system.
- Spring framework
- Sprint boot
- Spring data
- Spring security: consists of
        + Authentication: Proving your identity.
        + Authorization: The tasks for which access is allotted to you and the definition of your access in the system.
  It is a combination of 'tools' and 'frameworks' used for building Spring boot applications and using Spring security means protection of user data.

KEY SECURITY PRINCIPLES ->
1. Least Privilege.
2. Secure by Design.
3. Fail-safe defaults.
4. Secure communication.
5. Input validation.
6. Auditing and Logging.
7. Regular updates and Patch management.

* Working of Spring Security:
    In between the 'Requests' and the 'Controllers' - there exist the "Filter Chain". These chains can consist of anything which are used for proper implementation of the Spring boot functionality we wish to execute, ut in this reference,
    the "Filter Chains" consist of the Authentication Filter which is further broken down to the user's name and password which are called as the "AUTHENTICATION OBJECTS".
    These 'objects' are given to the authentication manager for further processing where the Authentication Manager decides what action need to be performed with the objects.
    He, the Authentication Manager, delegates this task to the Authentication Provider of authenticating the user (i.e., "LDABAuthenticationProvider / InMemoryAuthenticationProvider / DaoAuthenticationProvider"  + others are specific to Spring and their applicability depends on the way the data is being stored.).

    The Authentication Provider uses : 1. PasswordEncoder - It helps by decoding the password of the login user for verification.
                                       2. UserDetailsService - findByUsername() every detail of thee login-in user from the database.
